To zeroth-order, star formation is the collapse of a cloud of gas into a dense sphere that begins thermonuclear fusion.%TODO:Double Check Literature definition of a star.
If that were the case then one would naively think that the star formation effeciency (SFE), which is:
%
\be
{\rm SFE} = \frac{M_*}{M_{\rm gas}}, 
\ee
%
would equal 100\% in the time it takes for the entire cloud to collapse to a point.
The amount of time it takes for a cloud to collapse to a point is 
With this naive model in mind, one could believe that all of the gas in the cloud collapses into a star in the free-fall time.
That is to say, the Star Formation Effeciency (SFE) would be 100\%.
On galactic scales, star formation is observed to be slow as implied by the Kennicutt-Schmidt law \citep{1998ApJ...498..541K,2008AJ....136.2782L}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kennicutt}
 \dot{M}_* = \epsilon \frac{M_g}{\tau_{\rm dyn}}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon = 1-2\%$ of the mass of the gas, $M_g$ is converted to stars, $M_*$, per dynamical time, $\tau_{\rm dyn}$. 
Our toy model is too fast by a factor of 50! 
Obviously we are missing some crucial physics; there must be a force acting to slow the SFE.

On smaller scales, i.e., the scales of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), observations show a large scatter in the efficiency, $\epsilon$, in both GMCs \citep{2016ApJ...833..229L} and smaller clouds \citep{2014ApJ...782..114E}. 
Of course if the star formation rate on small scales is always small, then the large scale star formation rate needs no further explanation.


The star formation time on galactic scales is long when compared to the dynamical time. 
\citet{1998ApJ...498..541K} expressed this in the form
\begin{equation}
\dot{\Sigma}_* = \epsilon\Sigma_g \tau_{\rm DYN}^{-1}
\end{equation}
where $\dot{\Sigma}_*$ is the star formation rate per unit area, $\Sigma_g$ is the 
gas surface density, $\tau_{\rm DYN}$ is the local dynamical time, and $\epsilon = 0.017$ 
is the efficiency factor.  Naively, if the gas self-gravity dominates the dynamics, $\epsilon \sim 1$, so 
the low efficiency of star formation is surprising.  More recent work has refined this and similar relations in regard to its dependence on molecular gas \citep{2008AJ....136.2846B} and by taking into account the error distributions of both $\dot\Sigma_*$ and $\Sigma_g$ \citep{2013MNRAS.430..288S}, but the best current estimates of the efficiency of star formation on galactic scales remains low. 

Whether this low efficiency applies to scales comparable to giant molecular clouds, with radii of
order $100\pc$, is debated in the literature.
\citet{2010ApJ...723.1019H}, \citet{2010ApJ...724..687L}, \citet{2010ApJS..188..313W}, and \citet{2011ApJ...729..133M} 
find efficiencies a factor of ten or more larger, while \citet{2007ApJ...654..304K} and \citet{2012ApJ...745...69K} 
find $\epsilon\approx0.01$.
On these small scales, observations also suggest that the efficiency is not universal, but instead 
varies over two to three orders of magnitude (e.g.  
\citealt{1988ApJ...334L..51M,2016arXiv160805415L}).%2015ApJ...804...18A}).  

There are a number of explanations for the low star formation rate, on 
either small or large scales (although they may not be necessary for the former!). These include 
turbulent pressure support \citep{1992ApJ...396..631M}, support from magnetic fields
\citep{1966MNRAS.132..359S,1976ApJ...207..141M}, and stellar feedback (e.g.
\citealt{1986ApJ...303...39D}).  Numerical experiments investigating the first two 
effects suggest that neither turbulence nor magnetic support is sufficient 
to reduce the rate of star formation to $\epsilon\approx 0.02$ on small scales
\citep{2010ApJ...709...27W,2011MNRAS.410L...8C,2011ApJ...730...40P,2012ApJ...754...71K,2014MNRAS.439.3420M}.  Feedback from radiative effects and protostellar jets and winds may be able to explain the low star formation rate, but the impact of these forms of stellar feedback remains uncertain despite recent progress
\citep{2010ApJ...709...27W,2014MNRAS.439.3420M,2015MNRAS.450.4035F}.

Until very recently, galaxy-scale or larger (cosmological) simulations 
were not able to reproduce the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.  Nor 
did the cosmological runs reproduce correctly the mass of stars in galaxies of a given 
halo mass, despite including supernova and other forms of feedback, 
e.g., \citet{2010MNRAS.404.1111G,2010Natur.463..203G,2011MNRAS.410.2625P}.
To overcome this low resolution driven problem, \citet{2011MNRAS.417..950H,2012MNRAS.421.3522H}
performed high resolution (few parsec spatial, few hundred solar mass particle masses) simulations 
of isolated galaxies, modeling both radiative and supernovae feedback (among other forms). 
They recovered the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a result that they 
showed was independent of the small-scale star formation
law that they employed. The simulations in the second paper also generated galaxy 
scale outflows or winds, removing gas from the disk, thus making it unavailable for star 
formation. When the feedback was turned off, the star formation rate soared, demonstrating that
in the simulations at least, feedback was crucial to explaining the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and
the outflows. Simulations including supernovae but lacking the radiative component of the feedback
did not exhibit strong winds and so overproduced stars.

Cosmological simulations employing unresolved (or ``sub-grid") models for both 
radiative and supernovae feedback are now able to reproduce the halo-mass/stellar mass relation (e.g.,
\citealt{2013MNRAS.434.3142A,2014MNRAS.445..581H,2015ApJ...804...18A}). Again, 
these simulations {\em require} 
stellar feedback to drive the winds that remove gas from the disk, so as to 
leave the observed mass of stars behind. 

\citet{2015ApJ...800...49L} emphasized that the star formation efficiency on 
parsec scales is nonlinear 
in time, i.e., $\epsilon \propto t \rightarrow M_* \propto t^2$, on small scales, where $M_*$ is the total stellar mass. Magnetic fields slowed the initial star
formation rate somewhat, but did not change the $M_*(t)\sim t^2$ scaling. 
Using a detailed numerical simulation, they showed that this nonlinear star formation 
rate is driven by the properties of collapsing regions.
In particular, they demonstrated that the turbulent velocity near or in
collapsing regions follows 
different scaling relations than does turbulence in the global environment, which follows
Larson's law, $v_T(r)\sim r^{1/2}$ \citep{1981MNRAS.194..809L}. They also showed that the density PDF 
is not log-normal, but rather develops a power law to high density.
This latter result was hinted at by \citet{2000ApJ...535..869K} and shown convincingly, 
as well as explained, by \citet{2011ApJ...727L..20K}. 

The increasing rate of star formation found by \citet{2015ApJ...800...49L} is important 
in that it may provide an explanation for the observed range in star formation rates on 
small scales.  It suggests that the star formation rates on small scales 
vary in part because of the age of the star forming region; slow star forming 
regions, with very low instantaneous efficiencies, will ramp up their stellar production over time. If this result
can be firmly established, it will highlight the need for a form of very rapid 
feedback. In particular, since the dynamical time in massive star forming regions 
is much smaller than the time delay of $\sim 4{\,\rm Myrs}$ between the start of star 
formation and the first supernovae, rapid star formation on small scales would 
have to be halted by some form of feedback other than supernovae. 

The simulations of  \citet{2015ApJ...800...49L} explicate the link between the rate of star formation with the gravitational collapse of high density regions, which  is  an analytically well studied problem. 
An early model of \citet{1977ApJ...214..488S} estimated 
the accretion rate onto stars by assuming that stars form from hydrostatic cores 
supported by thermal gas pressure. The accretion rate in his model was independent
of time, given by $\dot{M} = m_0c_s^3/G$, where $c_s = (k_b T / \mu)^{1/2}$  is the sound
speed in molecular gas, and $m_0 = 0.975$. \citet{1977ApJ...214..488S} predicted a 
maximum accretion rate of $\sim 2\times10^{-6} M_\odot\,\yr^{-1}$, which is too small to explain 
the origin of massive ($M_*\sim50-100M_\odot$) O stars, which have lifetimes $\lesssim 4\times10^6\yrs$

\citet{1992ApJ...396..631M} overcame the difficulty with slow accretion rates by adopting 
the turbulent speed in lieu of the sound speed (see also \citet{1997ApJ...476..750M} and
\citet{2003ApJ...585..850M}). In doing so they were able to replace the slower signal 
speed of sound with the faster turbulent speed. However, they continued to assume 
the initial condition was that of a hydrostatic core that is supported by
turbulent pressure. They also assumed that the turbulence is static and unaffected by the collapse.  

Collectively, these models, \citep{1977ApJ...214..488S,1992ApJ...396..631M,1997ApJ...476..750M,2003ApJ...585..850M}, are referred to as inside-out collapse models; the collapse starts at small radii (formally at $r=0$ in the analytic models) and works its way outward, at the assumed propagation speed ($c_s$ or $v_T(r)$).  At any given time, the infall velocity and mass accretion rate both decrease with increasing radius $r$.  The analytic models assume the existence of a self-similarity variable $x = r/vt$, where $v=c_s$ in \citet{1977ApJ...214..488S} or the turbulent velocity $v_T(r)$ in \citet{1992ApJ...396..631M,1997ApJ...476..750M,2003ApJ...585..850M}.  
These models predict velocity and mass accretion profiles very different than those seen 
in the simulations of \citet{2015ApJ...800...49L}.
%; in particular, the analytic models do not predict any deviation of the turbulent velocity from Larson's size-linewidth relation.  

Motivated by this discrepancy,
\citet{2015ApJ...804...44M}, hereafter MC15, developed a 1-D model of
spherical collapse that treats the turbulent velocity, $v_T$, as a dynamical variable and
does not assume that the initial condition is a hydrostatically
supported region. They used the results of \citet{2012ApJ...750L..31R} on
compressible turbulence; the evolution
of the turbulent velocity in a collapsing (or expanding) region is
described well by the following equation:
%
\be
\frac{\partial v_{T}}{\partial t} + u_{r} \frac{\partial v_{T}}{\partial r} 
+ \left( 1 + \eta \frac{v_{T}}{u_{r}} \right) \frac{v_T u_r}{r} = 0
\label{eq:hydro_ Robertson}
\ee
%
The first two terms are the Lagrangian derivative, and $u_r$ is the radial infall velocity. The first term in the brackets 
describes the turbulent driving produced by the infall, while the second 
is the standard expression for the turbulent decay rate;  $\eta$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity.

MC15 used this in place of an energy equation. Together with the
equations for mass continuity and momentum, equation (\ref{eq:hydro_ Robertson}) gives a
closed set of equations that can be solved in spherical symmetry
numerically. In addition, they were able to analytically show that the
results of their calculations gave density and velocity profiles that
appear to be in line with both recent numerical calculations
\citep{2015ApJ...800...49L} and observations (e.g.,
\citealt{1995ApJ...446..665C,1997ApJ...476..730P}).

To summarize, MC15's major results were:
\begin{itemize}
\item The gravity of the newly formed star introduces a physical scale into the problem, which MC15 called the stellar sphere of influence, $r_*$. This is an idea familiar from galactic dynamics. 
The radius $r_*$ is where the local dynamics transitions from being 
dominated by the mass of the gas to being dominated 
by the mass of the star. As a result,the character of the solution, in particular that of the velocity, differs dramatically between $r<r_*$ and $r>r_*$.  The existence of this physical scale modifies the form of the self-similarity on which inside-out theories rely.

\item The small scale density profile is an attractor solution.  MC15 showed numerically and argued analytically that at small scales, the density profile is an attractor solution. 
In particular, MC15 showed the density profile asymptotes to: 
%
\be
\rho(r,t)=
\begin{dcases}
\rho(r_0)\left({\frac{r}{r_0}}\right)^{-3/2}, & r<r_*(t)\\
\rho(r_0,t)\left({\frac{r}{r_0}}\right)^{-k_\rho}, \ k_\rho\approx1.6-1.8 & r>r_*(t).
\end{dcases}
\label{eq:hydro_density}
\ee
%
where $r_0$ is some fiducial radius. 
\item The existence of $r_*$ implies that the infall and turbulent velocities have different scaling for $r<r_*$ and $r>r_*$.  In particular, MC15 showed
%
\be
u_r(r,t), v_T(r,t) \propto
\begin{dcases}
\sqrt{\frac{GM_*(t)}{r}} \sim r^{-1/2} & r<r_*(t)\\
\sqrt{\frac{GM(r,t)}{r}} \sim r^{0.2} & r>r_*(t),
\end{dcases}
\label{eq:hydro_infall_behavior}
\ee
%
Thus the scaling of the turbulent velocity differs from that predicted by Larson's law ($\propto r^{1/2}$) inside the sphere of influence. In other words, the turbulent velocity in  massive star forming regions will deviate from Larson's law, which has long been observed, but without theoretical explanation. 
\item The stellar mass increases quadratically with time.  This result  arises naturally from the attractor solution nature of the density profile at small $r$, Equation (\ref{eq:hydro_density}), and the scaling with Keplerian velocity for the turbulent and infall velocities at small $r$, Equation (\ref{eq:hydro_infall_behavior}).

The mass accretion rate: 
%
\be
\dot M(r,t)=
\begin{dcases}
4\pi R^2\rho(R)u_r(r,t), \sim t\,r^{0} & r<r_*\\
4\pi R^2\rho(R)u_r(r,t) \sim t^0\,r^{0.2} & r>r_*.
\end{dcases}
\label{eq:hydro_Mdot_behavior}
\ee
%
\end{itemize}



MC15's predictions for $r<r_*$ could not be checked using the simulations
of \citet{2015ApJ...800...49L} as those fixed grid simulations were
too coarse.  In this paper, we study the collapse of gas and formation
of stars in a turbulent GMC using roughly a dozen high resolution
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations in this paper.

In the late 1960's and early 1970's, star formation theory revolved around hydrostatic equilibrium supporting a cloud of gas and dust via the thermal pressure support. The thought process is that eventually, the density/mass becomes too great for the thermal pressure support, and the cloud collapses.
