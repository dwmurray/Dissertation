\section{Isolating the effect of random thermal motions}

The research which makes up the body of work in this dissertation was motivated, in large part, 
by the discrepancies between observations and the analytic models. 
Numerical simulations, as well, failed to account for the most recent insights into how stars form. 
My initial parameters for the simulations did not include the additional physics of magnetic fields, winds, jets or supernovae. 
This was an effort to understand how the system behaves at zeroth-order. 
%Motivated by disagreement between current analytic models, numerical simulations, and observations, we perform deep AMR simulations 
%of star formation in self-gravitating continuously driven hydrodynamic turbulence. 
%The purpose of proceeding without any additional physics, such as magnetic fields, stellar winds and jets, radiative feedback, supernovae, 
%is to determine how the zeroth-order system behaves.

The significance of my results is twofold--turbulence is, in fact, a dynamic variable, driven by adiabatic compression \citep{2012ApJ...750L..31R}, 
and the turbulence itself acts to slow the collapse. 
%Our results strongly support the basic premise of MC15: that turbulence is a dynamic variable 
%which is driven by adiabatic compression \citep{2012ApJ...750L..31R}, and that the turbulence
%in turn acts to slow the collapse. 
Furthermore, these outcomes are supported by observations made of massive star forming regions. 
As highlighted in this dissertation,  $\vt \propto r^p$ with $ p \sim 0.2-0.3$, and that at small radii or high density, $\vt$  
increases with increasing density, \citep{1997ApJ...476..730P}. 
We find these departures from Larson's law only in collapsing regions in our simulations. 
%We note, as did MC15, that observations of massive star forming regions also find $v_T \propto r^p$ 
%with $ p \sim 0.2-0.3$, and that at small radii or high density, $v_T$  
%increases with increasing density, as seen in observations of massive star forming
%regions \citep{1997ApJ...476..730P}. 
%We find these departures from Larson's law only in
%collapsing regions in our simulations. 

We show that two length scales emerge from the process of star formation, $r_*$ and $r_d$, and demonstrate
that these length scales are clearly associated with physical effects. 
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:sf_review} analytic theories assumed that the solution shows a self-similarity, and thus would present a power law solution.
We show that in fact, there are two power laws, which change at $r_*(t)$. 
One power law inside of $r_*$ (but outside $r_d$) $|\ur|$ and  $\vt$ are both
$\propto r^{-1/2}$; and outside of $r_*$, $\vt \sim r^{p}$ (with $p\approx0.2$), while $|\ur|$ 
is on average about constant. 
It is worth emphasizing, that $r_*(t)$, the length scale at which the character of the solution changes, is time dependent. 
As the star grows in mass, the radius where the stars' gravity exceeds the gravity of the surrounding gas increases outwards away from the star, 
$r_*(t) \propto M_*^{2/3}(t)$.
The disk radius, $r_d$, also changes as a function of time as a result of the advection and transport of angular momentum from largescales to small scales (and vice versa).

I found that the density profile evolves to a fixed attractor, $\rho(r,t ) \rightarrow \rho(r)$. 

I also show that the acceleration due to the pressure gradient is comparable to that due to gravity at all $r>r_d$. 
As a result, the infall velocity is substantially smaller than the free fall velocity
even very close to the star or accretion disk. 
Inside $r_d$, rotational support takes over and as a result $\ur$ and $\vt$ both decrease.  

Our simulations capture rotational dynamics that MC15 did not capture in their 1-D model.  
In particular, we find the development of rotationally support disks at $r_d \sim 0.01$ pc.  
These disks have radii comparable to  or slightly larger than disks seen around 
young stars in Taurus \citep{1999AJ....117.1490P} in which stellar feedback effects are minimal,
and where the undisturbed disks are larger than in more active star forming regions such as Orion, 
where the disk radii are $\sim 100\AU$ \citep{2011ARA&A..49...67W}.  
This is despite the fact that we do not include magnetohydrodynamic effects 
in our numerical computations;  large scale magnetic fields may transfer angular 
momentum away from these disks, shrinking them.  

Like the disks modeled by \citet{2010ApJ...708.1585K},
our simulated disks are 
marginally gravitationally stable, suggesting that large scale gravitational torques are 
responsible for transport of material and angular momentum in our simulations; this may
also be true at early times in real protostellar disks.  

We have shown that the assumptions made by previous analytic collapse models
\citep{1977ApJ...214..488S,1992ApJ...396..631M,1997ApJ...476..750M,2003ApJ...585..850M}, 
are not fulfilled in our simulations.  In particular, 
the collapsing regions in our simulations do not start from a hydrostatic equilibrium, nor 
do they show any evidence of inside-out collapse.  The gathering of material before collapse, i.e.,
before the central cusp in the density power law is formed, involves transonic bulk motions 
and supersonic random motions (see Figure \ref{fig:hydro_velocity_avg}). The accretion of mass starts at large 
scales ($r\sim 1\pc$) with large initial infall velocities.  In addition, we find that $\vt$ 
scales differently in collapsing regions as opposed to the rest of the simulation box, 
whereas the turbulent collapse models \citep{1997ApJ...476..750M,2003ApJ...585..850M} assume 
that the scaling of $\vt$ with $r$ remains fixed.  

%Finally, we close with a brief discussion of how our results relate to turbulence regulated theories of star formation. Here we find several points of disagreement. 
%First, we find that the star 
%particles accrete continuously from the surrounding large scale turbulent flow; there is 
%no hydrostatic ``core'' that is cut-off from the turbulent medium. Second, 
%the density distribution does not remain log-normal, but rather develops a power law tail that 
%is directly related to the density profile \citep{2011ApJ...727L..20K,2015ApJ...800...49L}.  
%Third, the fact that the density profile approaches an attractor solution that scales like 
%$r^{-3/2}$ for $r<r_*$ and $u_r$ scales with the Keplerian velocity guarantees that $\dot{M}$ is 
%constant with radius and $\dot{M}_*\propto t$ and hence a non-linear star formation efficiency, 
%i.e., $M_* \propto t^2$ results. This is in contrast with turbulence regulated theories of star 
%formation that predict a constant star formation rate, i.e., $\dot{M}_* = {\rm const}$ and, 
%hence, a linear star formation efficiency $M_* \propto t$. 

\section{The effect of protostellar Jets}
%We performed simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating gas including star particle formation and protostellar jets. 
%Starteing with uniform density in a box with length $16$ parsecs on a side, we drove turbulence until we reached a statistically steady state.
%At that point, the density was no longer uniform.
%We then turned on gravity and star formation.
%We used AMR to follow collapsing regions down to an effective resolution of $32 \, K^3$ which gave us a $\Delta x$ of $100 {\rm AU}$ at the finest level of refinement.

We observed that the inclusion of protostellar jets does not affect the general dynamics of accreting gas.
In particular we saw $M_*(t) \propto f^2 (t-t_*)^2$ where $f = 1 - f_{\rm jet}$ is the fraction of mass accreted onto the protostar and $f_{\rm jet}$ is the fraction ejected by the jet.
We find that this mass ejection accounts for 75\% of the effect of jets on the star formation rate in our simulations.
This appears to be the case in similar simulations performed by other groups (e.g. see Figure \ref{fig:jet_fed_comp}), but we find suggestions that this may be altered if MHD is included.

As we have found previously in the case without jets \citep{2017MNRAS.465.1316M}, the spherical average profile of gas around the protostar follows the analytic model of MC15 and does not seem the change in the case with jets.  In particular, the run of density finds an attractor solution prior to star formation and remains on that solution even after jets begin to blow out cavities in the surrounding medium.
The behavior of the infall and rotational velocities is similar regardless of whether jets are included or not.
The profile of the random velocities are also similar once the jet bi-cone is removed.  Finally, the mass accretion rates are similar in the jet and no-jet cases.

We also find that the collapse is outside-in  \citep{2017MNRAS.465.1316M}, and holds for both the jet and no jet simulations.
The average jet momentum per stellar mass does increase over time, though this is to be expected as the stars continue to accrete mass.
We did not run long enough for the stars to completely consume the surrounding gas and thus for the jets to begin to be shut off.
We find that jets do drive turbulence in the surrounding gas, but is confined to small scales of roughly a parsec.

\section{Future Work}
While the results presented here are a step in the direction of determining the process of star formation, there is much that still needs to be completed. 

This theory and the results of this dissertation, has not yet looked at the effect of magnetic fields. 
There are several papers \citet{2017ApJ...838...40M} ({\bf include more}), which suggest that magnetic fields may have an effect on the rate of star formation. 
Whether that contribution changes the currently found $M_*(t) \propto t^2$ profile or merely modifies the normalization like the protostellar jets has yet to be determined. 

Our simulations also negelect strong physical effects at late times. 
Our lack of radiation is relevantly not physically accurate for sink particles that grow beyond $\sim 4 \Msun$, 
as the mass of stars grows the effects of radiation from these massive stars will have a strong impact on the surrounding medium. 

Radiative feedback will also affect both the IMF and, for massive enough stars, the dynamics of the collapse at late times (after massive stars have formed). 

To estimate the effects of radiation, we compare the force from the Reynold stress $F_T=4\pi r^2 \rho v_T^2$, to the radiation force $L/c$. 
From Figure \ref{fig:hydro_velocity_avg}, the (averaged over many stars) $v_T$ is slightly in excess of $1\kms$ at $r=0.01\pc$, while from any of the density figures the density is $\rho\approx5\times10^{-18} {\rm g/cm}^3$. The force from Reynold stress is then $F\approx4\times 10^{26}$ dynes. The luminosity of a 4 solar mass star on the zero age main sequence is $L\approx 2\times10^{36}\ergs$ \citep{1992A&AS...96..269S}, so the radiation force $L/c \approx 3\times10^{25}\,{\rm dynes}$, about a 10\% effect.  The force from Reynolds stress increases outward, see Figure \ref{fig:hydro_dPdr_avg}, so this statement holds at larger radii as well. 

Thus we expect that the effects of radiation pressure are not particularly significant in the situations we report;  the run of density and infall velocity, and hence the $M_*(t)\sim t^2$ scaling should not be affected, at least up to the times we are reporting on.  We note, however, that this estimate neglects the effect of radiative or ionization heating which is an important feedback mechanism.

Simulations including radiative feedback support this simple analysis. Figure 15 of  \citet{2014MNRAS.439.3420M} shows that in their simulations, which include feedback from both protostellar outflows and radiation (as well as magnetic fields), the stellar mass increases as the square of the time, up to masses of ~4.5 solar masses. Earlier work by the Berkeley group found similar results, forming stars with 10 solar masses, with $M_*(t)~ t^2$ even for such massive stars, see Figure 13 of \citet{2012ApJ...754...71K}. Their simulations included radiative effects, but no proto-stellar winds. 


This is clearly seen in observations. Thus, a logical next step after the inclusion of magnetic fields would be to include the effect of radiation from these massive young stars. 

Other contributions that can be made include looking at the chemistry of these regions, as that would allow viable predicitions to be made about the type and amount of emission and absroption of radiation that may be seen. 
This would allow more accurate testing of the current theory of star formation by the latest generation of telescopes.
